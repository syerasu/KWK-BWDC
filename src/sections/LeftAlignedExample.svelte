                    You can use Svelte to add and remove data from a Highcharts
                    chart.

                <p>
                    When you click the button above, a third group is toggled in
                    the chart. Check out the source code to see how it's done.

                        checkboxes or radio buttons, in a similar way to filter

                You might notice that this basic template doesn't have certain
                features that are common in scrollytelling.

            <ArticleText>
                For example, you might want a component that doesn't feature a
                sticky component at all. Or a component that is solely a sticky
                component.
            </ArticleText>

            <ArticleText>
                You might also want to add more interactivity or gamify parts of
                your scrollytelling piece.
