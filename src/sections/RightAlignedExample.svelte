      <ArticleText>
        As seen in the pie chart, more than <strong>60%</strong> of the average household expenditure in the Bronx is allocated to housing and transportation costs, leaving less than <strong>40%</strong> for other essential needs like food and health services.
      </ArticleText>

      <ArticleText>
        We are privileged not to have to worry about having a roof over our heads or about where the money for necessities like food or healthcare will come from.
      </ArticleText>

      <ArticleText>
        The lack of worry about these basic needs allows us to focus on our education and personal growth, which is a luxury that we are lucky enough to take advantage of. <strong>This is a privilege not afforded to many.</strong>

<!-- Broadband Gap Section -->
<section class="left-aligned-section">
  <h2>The Bronx is buffering.</h2>
  <p> The Bronx is home to over 1.4 million people, yet itâ€™s often left behind in the digital age. Nearly <strong>1 in 4 households</strong> in the Bronx still donâ€™t have reliable broadband internet.
  </p>
  <p>
    Compare that to just <strong>1 in 10</strong> in Manhattan. This isnâ€™t just a tech issueâ€”itâ€™s a symptom of something deeper.
  </p>
  <p> Only 22% of Bronx residents (age 25+) hold a bachelorâ€™s degree, among the lowest in NYC.
